   â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
   â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
   â””â”€â”€ README.md
   ```

### Step 2.2: Navigate to Project Directory
Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project:
```bash
cd path/to/quiz-platform
```

### Step 2.3: Setup Backend
```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp config/.env.example .env
```

### Step 2.4: Setup Frontend
Open a **new terminal window** and run:
```bash
# Navigate to frontend folder (from project root)
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

---

## 3. Database Configuration

### Step 3.1: Start MySQL Server
**Windows:**
- MySQL should start automatically after installation
- If not, open "Services" and start "MySQL80" service

**macOS:**
- Open System Preferences > MySQL
- Click "Start MySQL Server"

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo service mysql start
```

### Step 3.2: Create Database
1. Open terminal and connect to MySQL:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```
2. Enter your root password when prompted
3. Create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE quiz_platform;
   USE quiz_platform;
   exit;
   ```

### Step 3.3: Configure Environment Variables
Edit the `.env` file in the `backend` folder:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password_here
DB_NAME=quiz_platform
DB_PORT=3306
```

**Important:** Replace `your_mysql_password_here` with your actual MySQL root password!

## 4. Running the Application

### Step 4.1: Start the Backend Server
In the terminal where you're in the `backend` folder:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
- "Server running on port 5000"
- "Database connection established successfully"
- "Database tables created successfully"

If you see errors, check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

### Step 4.2: Start the Frontend Application
In the **second terminal** where you're in the `frontend` folder:
```bash
npm start
```

This will:
- Start the React development server
- Automatically open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Step 4.3: Verify Everything is Working
You should see:
- Backend running on http://localhost:5000
- Frontend running on http://localhost:3000
- A login/register page when you visit the frontend

## 5. Testing the Application

### Step 5.1: Create User Accounts
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Register here"
3. Create at least 2 user accounts:
   - Username: player1, Email: player1@test.com, Password: test123
   - Username: player2, Email: player2@test.com, Password: test123

### Step 5.2: Test Room Creation
1. Login with player1
2. Click "Create New Quiz Room"
3. Click "Create Room"
4. Note the room code (e.g., ABC123)

### Step 5.3: Test Joining Room
1. Open a new browser window/tab
2. Go to http://localhost:3000
3. Login with player2
4. Click "Join Existing Room"

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up
3. Drag and drop the `build` folder to deploy
4. Note your site URL (e.g., https://amazing-quiz-app.netlify.app)

#### Backend Deployment (Railway)
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" > "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your GitHub account and select your repository
4. Choose the backend folder
5. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard
6. Note your backend URL (e.g., https://quiz-backend.railway.app)

#### Database (Railway MySQL)

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Cannot connect to database"
**Solution:**
1. Check if MySQL is running: `brew services start mysql` (macOS) or start MySQL service (Windows)
2. Verify credentials in `.env` file
3. Try creating database manually: `mysql -u root -p`, then `CREATE DATABASE quiz_platform;`

#### Issue: "Port 3000 is already in use"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000
```

#### Issue: "npm install fails"
**Solution:**
1. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
2. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
3. Run `npm install` again

#### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're in the correct directory (`backend` or `frontend`)
2. Run `npm install` again
3. Check if the file path is correct

#### Issue: Socket connection fails
**Solution:**
1. Check if backend is running on port 5000
2. Verify CORS settings in backend
3. Check browser console for specific error messages

#### Issue: Questions don't load
**Solution:**
1. Check if database schema was created properly
2. Verify sample data was inserted
3. Check backend logs for SQL errors

### Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the console logs:**
   - Backend: Look at terminal where backend is running
   - Frontend: Press F12 in browser, check Console tab

2. **Common file locations:**
   - Backend logs: Terminal where you ran `npm run dev`
   - Database issues: Check `.env` file configuration
   - Frontend issues: Browser Developer Tools (F12)

3. **Reset everything:**
   ```bash
   # Stop all servers (Ctrl+C in terminals)
   # Clear database
   mysql -u root -p
   DROP DATABASE quiz_platform;
   CREATE DATABASE quiz_platform;
   exit;

   # Restart backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
